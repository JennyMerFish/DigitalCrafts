        <p>I was born and raised here in Alief, Texas, and I graduated early from Kerr High School. I bounced around different jobs for a few years, trying to figure out what I wanted to do, when I landed a job at my boyfriend's place of work, a printing company. A became a client coordinator for register tape coupons, and edited thousands of coupons a month. We had strict print deadlines, quality standards, and the job was fast-paced and stressful. I LOVED❤️ it.

            After having kids I was lucky enough to be able to stay home and raise them. Once they grew up a little, I decided to get back in the workforce, and tried my hand at bartending. When my youngest child started preschool, the school director asked me to take on a teaching position, and I agreed. I bartended and taught preschoolers until March of 2020, when both of my jobs abruptly shut down due to Covid. Now I'm at Digital Crafts, and I'm ready to make waves in the developing world.</p>
